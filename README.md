# NOTICE: this config is made for the BUNGEECORD variant of this plugin, but im pretty sure its the same as the spigot version.

This is the YAML configuration for the plugin 'AdvancedBan'
This config file has the prefix disabled so there is no "AdvancedBan >>" when an action is taken against a player. Also i have made the colours look a bit nicer, and the ban screen more functional and more informational.

As of 09/02/2021 this plugin is compatible with Minecraft version 1.7x - 1.16x and compatible with spigot, bukkit, paper (and any forks of these flavours)

You can find the AdvancedBan plugin on the spigot page <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/advancedban.8695/">here</a>
