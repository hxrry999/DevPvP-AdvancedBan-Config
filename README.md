# DevPvP AdvancedBan Plugin Config

#Warning this config is made for the BUNGEECORD variant of this plugin but im pretty sure its the same as the spigot version.
This is a configuration for the plugin 'AdvancedBan'
This config file has the prefix disabled so there is no "AdvancedBan >>" when an action is taken against a player, Also i have made the colours look a bit nicer and the ban screen more functional and more informational.

As of 09/02/2021 this plugin is compatiable with minecraft version 1.7x - 1.16x and compatiable with spigot, paper, bukkit and purper.

You can find the advancedban plugin from the spigot page <a href="https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/advancedban.8695/">here</a>
